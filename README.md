Overview of the analysis

  The purpose of this analysis is to collect and examine weather data in Oahu to determine if the location will be viable enough to open a surf and ice cream shop. Using tools like SQLAlchemy, we can query weather data from previous years to view trends in temperature(s) and precipitation levels. Further in our analysis, we narrow down our data to two specific months: June and December. This is because we want to retrieve weather data from two major seasons, to get a general understanding of Oahu’s weather, as this venture would be operating year-round.

Results

1.	The first key difference is the total count for temperatures from dates in June and December. June had a higher total count than December, by 183 values. This could possibly skew the data, in case either of the month’s had dates where the temperature was increasingly warm or chilly.

2.	Secondly, there is a logical difference in the average temperature calculated for June and December. The average temperature in June was calculated to be approximately 75 degrees in Fahrenheit, whereas December’s average temperature was 71 degrees in Fahrenheit. 

3.	The last notable difference between June and December’s weather would be the minimum and maximum temperatures found in both months. The minimum temperature in June is 64 F, whereas in December, it drops down to 56 F. The maximum temperatures for both months are comparable, with 85 F and 83 F for the two months, consecutively. 

Summary

The destination chosen for the surf and ice cream shop seems quite ideal, as Hawaii is an island which lies near the equator. This means that the weather throughout the year should remain relatively warm, even in the winter season. Through our queries thus far, we can determine the average temperature in June and December, which are two of the peak months for tourism. Further queries which can be created using Hawaii’s weather data is to calculate humidity and wind levels/hour. These two factors significantly impact temperature, and having collective data on them can assist W. Avy when it comes to building a strong external structure of the shop. Another important query which can be formulated to see Oahu’s weather trends, is the surf forecast. Since this shop will primarily be selling surf boards and surf equipment, it is important to have a daily surf report of the tides, strong waves and warnings for the surrounding body of water.
