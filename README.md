# surfs_up

Overview of the analysis

  The purpose of this analysis is to collect and examine weather data in Oahu to determine if the location will be viable enough to open a surf and ice cream shop. Using tools like SQLAlchemy, we can query weather data from previous years to view trends in temperature(s) and precipitation levels. Further in our analysis, we narrow down our data to two specific months: June and December. This is because we want to retrieve weather data from two major seasons, in order to get a general understanding of Oahuâ€™s weather, as this venture would be operating year-round.
